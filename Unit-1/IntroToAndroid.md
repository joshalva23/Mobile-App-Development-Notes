# **Introduction to Android**  

This subtopic introduces the Android operating system, its architecture, and the steps to start developing Android applications using Android Studio.

## **1. Overview of Android**  

Android is an **open-source operating system** developed by Google, based on the **Linux kernel**. It is designed primarily for **touchscreen devices** like smartphones and tablets but also powers other devices such as **TVs, wearables, and IoT devices**.  

### **Key Features of Android**  
- **Open Source:** Highly customizable by device manufacturers and developers.  
- **Wide Adoption:** Supports a diverse range of devices and hardware configurations.  
- **Rich App Ecosystem:** Offers millions of apps through the Google Play Store.  
- **Development Support:** Provides tools and libraries for efficient app development.  

### **Android Versions**  
Android releases were named after **desserts (up to version 9)** and are now identified by **numbers (from version 10 onward)**. Each version introduces **new features, UI enhancements, and security updates**.

## **2. Android Architecture**  

Androidâ€™s architecture is divided into **five main layers**:  

### **1. Linux Kernel**  
- Acts as the **core layer** of the Android OS.  
- Manages **device drivers, memory, power, and process control**.  

### **2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**  
- Interfaces between the **Android system and hardware-specific drivers**.  
- Ensures **compatibility across different hardware devices**.  

### **3. Android Runtime (ART)**  
- Executes Android applications using **bytecode compiled from Java/Kotlin**.  
- Includes **Garbage Collection** for memory management.  

### **4. Native C/C++ Libraries**  
- Provides **essential functionalities** such as media playback, graphics, and database support.  
- **Examples:** SQLite, OpenGL, WebKit.  

### **5. Application Framework**  
- Exposes **APIs for building apps**, including **UI design, data management, and hardware interaction**.  
- **Key Components:**  
  - **Activities** (UI screens of an app).  
  - **Services** (background tasks).  
  - **Broadcast Receivers** (system-wide event listeners).  
  - **Content Providers** (data-sharing between apps).  

### **6. Applications**  
- The **topmost layer** where **user-installed and system apps** operate.  
- **Examples:** Phone, Contacts, Settings, and third-party apps.

## **3. Setting Up the Development Environment**  

Before starting Android development, you need to **configure the development environment**.  

### **Installing Android Studio**  
1. **Download Android Studio:**  
   - Obtain the latest version from the **[official Android website](https://developer.android.com/studio)**.  
2. **Install Required Components:**  
   - Install the **Android SDK, Emulator, and system images** during setup.  
3. **Configure SDK Manager:**  
   - Download **specific APIs and system images** for targeted Android versions.  

### **Creating Your First Android App Project**  
1. Open Android Studio and click on **"Start a new Android Studio project."**  
2. Choose a template (e.g., **Empty Activity**).  
3. Configure the **Project Name, Package Name, and Save Location**.  
4. Select the **Minimum SDK level** to determine compatibility with Android devices.

## **4. Running an App on the Emulator or a Device**  

After setting up the project, you can **run your app** on either an emulator or a physical device.  

### **Using the Emulator**  
1. Create a **Virtual Device (AVD)** using the **AVD Manager**.  
2. Select **hardware configurations and system images** for the emulator.  
3. Run the emulator and test the app within Android Studio.  

### **Using a Physical Device**  
1. **Enable Developer Options** and **USB Debugging** on your Android device.  
2. Connect the device to your computer via **USB**.  
3. Deploy the app directly to the device using **Android Studio**.

## **5. Key Tools in Android Studio**  

- **Code Editor:** Integrated with features like **syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking**.  
- **Layout Editor:** Provides a **drag-and-drop** interface for designing app UIs.  
- **Logcat:** Displays **system logs and debugging messages**.  
- **Gradle:** A **build automation tool** for compiling and packaging apps.
